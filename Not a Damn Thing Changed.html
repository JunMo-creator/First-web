<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>All the boys that grew up back-to-back still do the same things
<br>Now they're rewarding our records
<br>But we still do the same things
<br>I'm just spittin' words out my mouth
<br>I made it, I still don't know how
<br>Damn it, my stage show can light up the clouds
<br>Now I'm gonna blow it until I go out
<br>Bring it
<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>Just the funerals that follow death some more pain
<br>We're drinking beers and we're lighting up joints in the cold rain
<br>I'm glad I got somewhere to go
<br>I know a few souls without hope
<br>Brother, you know you can call if you're broke
<br>Damn it, I pray you won't reach for that rope
<br>So pour out a shot for me
<br>Keep pouring out the bottle for the real ones I lost
<br>Who can no longer walk with me
<br>For the ones still right here, yeah, for the ones who still care
<br>Yeah, we still feel the same way
<br>Just pushing in the same lane
<br>Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
<br>Always doing me so I have to maintain
<br>Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan
<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>Got my team from day one, there's not one I could replace
<br>Staying true to the way I grew up, how we were raised
<br>My boys, they go in and go out
<br>I'm just spittin' words out my mouth
<br>So far away but I still make them proud
<br>Damn it, I hope we all make it somehow
<br>Bring it
<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>I'm just tryna put feelings as words on this damn page
<br>Some of my friends started leaving this life 'cause they couldn't wait
<br>They know how it feels without hope
<br>I'm glad I got somewhere to go
<br>Stick to my people, that's people I know
<br>They feel the same, we all follow that code
<br>Now pour out a shot for me
<br>Keep pouring out the bottle for the real ones I lost
<br>Who can no longer walk with me
<br>For the ones still right here, yeah, for the ones who still care
<br>Yeah, we still feel the same way
<br>Just pushing in the same lane
<br>Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
<br>Always doing me so I have to maintain
<br>Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan
<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>Won't forget where I'm from but for me there's just one way
<br>It's a habit of beating the goals that we once made
<br>I got a few records to break
<br>I know we all got what it takes
<br>The team is the team, same as back in the day
<br>The team is the team, same as back in the day
<br>Not a damn thing changed
<br>If I wanted to turn back, it's already too late
<br>Yeah, we just grew up too quick 'cause we
<br>'Cause we couldn't wait
<br>Pushing in the same lane
<br>Tryna sit still, keep looking at the main aim
<br>Always doing me so I have to maintain
<br>Not a damn thing changed, just sticking to the game plan
