  <br>Well you only need the light when it's burning low
<br>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
<br>Only hate the road when you're missing home
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>And you let her go
<br>Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
<br>But dreams come slow and they go so fast
<br>You see her when you close your eyes
<br>Maybe one day you'll understand why
<br>Everything you touch surely dies
<br>'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
<br>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
<br>Only hate the road when you're missing home
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Staring at the ceiling in the dark
<br>Same old empty feeling in your heart
<br>Love comes slow and it goes so fast
<br>Well you see her when you fall asleep
<br>But never to touch and never to keep
<br>'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep
<br>'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
<br>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
<br>Only hate the road when you're missing home
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>And you let her go
<br>Oh oh oh no
<br>And you let her go
<br>Oh oh oh no
<br>And you let her go
<br>Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
<br>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
<br>Only hate the road when you're missing home
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
<br>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
<br>Only hate the road when you're missing home
<br>Only know you love her when you let her go
<br>And you let her go
